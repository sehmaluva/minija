# Issue guidelines

Use the Bug report template for reproducible issues.

Use the Feature request template for ideas and enhancements.

Auto-assignment and labeling:

- Issues opened via templates will include labels and assign the maintainer.

- If an issue has no label, the repository Action will add a `triage` label.

Common labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `triage`.

Priority labels: `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`. If you don't set a priority, the default `priority:medium` will be applied.
